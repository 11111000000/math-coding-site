# 06-self-application

This packet realises [[docs/axioms.md#a6-self-application-meta|axiom Self-Application]].

## Thesis

The convention applies to itself. Every axiom above is
realised as a packet under `math/`. The verifier that
checks those packets is itself the subject of a packet.
The probe that proves axiom Self-Application holds is
axiom Self-Application made operational.

Formally:

```
A6.  ∀ packet P ∈ math/* :
        ∀ axiom A_i (i ∈ {0,..,5}) :
          P satisfies A_i
```

axiom Self-Application is the closing of the loop. The
seven axioms are seven packets. The `core/` scripts are
themselves subjects of packets. The verifier exit-code is
itself a witness in `applications[]`.

`sh core/self/probe.sh` is the proof: when the script
returns 0, the convention has applied itself to its own
state and found itself consistent.

## Antithesis

A convention that cannot verify itself relies on external
authority — a maintainer, a reviewer, a runtime. That
authority can disappear; the convention then rots in
silence.

Many conventions are exactly this. They have a README that
asserts "we follow these principles" and no script that
checks whether the principles are followed. The principles
are held in the maintainer's head; when the maintainer
leaves, the principles leave.

Some conventions try to test themselves via a CI pipeline
that runs after every commit. This is necessary but not
sufficient. CI can check that tests pass; it cannot check
that the axioms are coherent. axiom Self-Application is
more than CI. It is the convention observing its own
structure.

## Synthesis

axiom Self-Application closes the loop. The proof
obligation is

```
sh core/self/probe.sh  →  exit 0
```

The probe runs six checks:

  [1/6]  every math/<pkt>/ has five files
  [2/6]  docs/axioms.md lists seven axioms
  [3/6]  theories/ contains eight theories
  [4/6]  core/check/verify.sh exits 0
  [5/6]  core/check/drift-check.sh detects no drift
  [6/6]  axiom packets form a dependency chain

Each check is a predicate (axiom Process). The conjunction
of the six predicates is axiom Self-Application. The probe
evaluates the conjunction. If all six hold, exit 0.

The proof of axiom Self-Application is axiom
Self-Application itself. The script that proves axiom
Self-Application is a script written under axiom
Self-Application (axiom Curry-Howard: a script is a
proof term; axiom Process: the script's lifecycle is
verified because the probe runs; axiom Accounting: the
probe's exit code is the witness).

## What this means in practice

When you run `sh math-coding probe`, the convention runs
against itself. The seven axiom packets are the test
fixtures. The probe is the test runner. The exit code is
the verdict.

If you change `core/self/probe.sh` and break axiom
Self-Application, the probe exits non-zero. The convention
tells you. You fix the probe. axiom Self-Application
holds again.

If you change a theory file and the theory drifts from
what axiom packets cite, the probe exits non-zero. The
convention tells you. You align the theory with the packet.

The convention is not a static document. It is a system
that observes itself.

## A worked example

When the backlinks commit (12ece14) introduced edits to
each axiom packet's `decision.md`, the recorded SHA in
`applications[]` became stale for two packets (A6 and
packet-lifecycle). The convention caught the drift
immediately:

```
$ sh math-coding drift-check
DRIFT: 06-self-application application 9fd84a9... stale
DRIFT: packet-lifecycle application 9fd84a9... stale
applied: 6, lookahead: 0, drift: 2
```

This is axiom Self-Application in action. The convention
detected that its own witness was stale. Two fix commits
refreshed the SHA; the drift cleared; axiom Self-Application held again.

```
$ sh math-coding drift-check
applied: 8, lookahead: 0, drift: 0
```

The convention observed its own drift and recorded the
observation. axiom Self-Application is real because the
convention recorded it happening.

## Surface impact

touches: the six checks in `core/self/probe.sh`:
  [1/6] 5 files per packet (axiom Curry-Howard)
  [2/6] seven axioms in docs/axioms.md (axiom Process)
  [3/6] eight theories in theories/ (axiom Process)
  [4/6] verify.sh exit 0 (axiom Curry-Howard)
  [5/6] drift-check.sh exit 0 (axiom Accounting)
  [6/6] axiom dependency chain closed (axiom Process)

## Proof

The proof is the probe itself. `sh core/self/probe.sh`
exits 0 ⟺ the convention's own packets satisfy the
structure their verifier demands, the axioms in
docs/axioms.md cohere with the theories in theories/,
the core/ scripts run on a minimal POSIX shell, the
applications[] SHA witnesses resolve to real commits.

The proof of axiom Self-Application is axiom
Self-Application itself.

## Task

# 06-self-application

## Problem

How does the convention prove that it is internally
consistent? What runs the proof?

## Desired outcome

A meta axiom — A6 — and the script that satisfies it.

When `sh core/self/probe.sh` returns 0, the convention
has applied its own rules to its own state. The exit-code
is the witness.

## Constraints

- The script must run on a minimal POSIX environment.
- The script must check all seven axioms coherently.
- The script must not depend on any non-core/ artifact.
## Assumptions

```yaml
task_id: 06-self-application
assumptions:
  - id: A1
    statement: "the convention's own packets must satisfy its verifier"
    status: user-confirmed
    epistemology: judgment
    evidence: |
      The seven axiom packets live under math/ and must
      pass core/check/verify.sh. Their verifier is one of
      the artifacts under core/.
  - id: A2
    statement: "probe.sh exits 0 iff the convention is internally consistent"
    status: user-confirmed
    epistemology: judgment
    evidence: |
      probe.sh runs core/check/verify.sh against every
      math/<pkt>/, then checks coherence between docs/axioms.md
      and theories/, then runs core/check/drift-check.sh on
      the axioms' applications[] entries.
  - id: A3
    statement: "the meta-check is itself a packet"
    status: agent-inferred
    epistemology: fact
    confidence: 0.99
    evidence: |
      This packet — math/06-self-application/ — is the
      meta-check made into a 5-file packet. Its existence
      is the proof that the convention applies to itself.```

## Refinement

# Refinement: 06-self-application

## State

- pre: the convention exists in fragments — packets, scripts,
  theories, axioms — but no single act demonstrates their
  mutual coherence.
- post: `sh core/self/probe.sh` runs and returns 0. The
  convention has applied itself to its own state and found
  itself consistent.

## Operation

probe.sh performs these checks:

1. Every math/<pkt>/ has exactly five files.
2. Every packet.yaml declares one of the seven epistemic
   markers per assumption.
3. Every axiom packet references its predecessors in
   depends_on:.
4. docs/axioms.md lists exactly seven axioms in canonical
   order (A0, A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6).
5. theories/ contains the eight theories cited from the
   seven axiom packets.
6. Every application[] SHA resolves to a real commit in
   the git history.

## Mapping

| A6 obligation | probe.sh check |
|--------------|----------------|
| five files per packet | `find math -name packet.yaml \| wc -l` matches count of `*/{decision,task,assumptions,refinement}.md` |
| epistemic markers | grep assumptions.yaml for invalid markers |
| depends_on chain | topological sort; reject cycles |
| axioms doc | grep `^## A[0-9]\.` for exactly seven |
| theories present | for each theory cited in axiom packets, assert file exists |
| SHA witness | for each SHA in applications[], assert git rev-parse succeeds |

## Invariant preservation

- A6 holds across all edits that pass probe.sh.
- A6 cannot hold vacuously: probe.sh is a POSIX shell
  script that runs against the real filesystem and real
  git history.

## Test obligation

- probe.sh exit 0 = axiom Self-Application proven.
- probe.sh exit non-zero = drift; the verdict lists the
  first failing check.

## Runtime check

- axiom Self-Application itself — the convention's own runtime.
