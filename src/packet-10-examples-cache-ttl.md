# cache-ttl

## Thesis

Cache entries expire after 60 seconds. Manual invalidation
is a separate endpoint.

## Antithesis

Users may need to invalidate cache immediately when upstream
data changes. A fixed TTL forces them to wait up to 60 seconds
for the next refresh.

## Synthesis

Two paths, independent:
  1. TTL: cache entries auto-expire after 60 seconds.
  2. Invalidation: explicit `--cache-invalidate` endpoint
     forces immediate eviction.

The TTL is configurable per cache type. The invalidation
is idempotent (multiple calls have the same effect as one).

## Surface impact

touches: CLI --cache-invalidate [FROZEN], Cache API [FLUID]

## Proof

tests/contract/test_cache_ttl.spec:
  - test_ttl_default_60s
  - test_ttl_configurable
  - test_invalidation_immediate
  - test_invalidation_idempotent

## Task

# cache-ttl

## Problem

Stale data is served indefinitely after upstream changes
because the cache has no expiration policy.

## Desired outcome

Cache entries expire after a configurable TTL (default 60
seconds). Manual invalidation is available as a separate
endpoint for cases where freshness is critical.

## Constraints

- TTL must be configurable per cache type.
- Invalidation must be idempotent (safe to call multiple
  times).
- No code change for in-process cache: just a wrapper.
## Assumptions

```yaml
task_id: cache-ttl
assumptions:
  - id: A1
    statement: "60s is acceptable for this endpoint"
    status: user-confirmed
    epistemology: fact
    confidence: 0.95
    evidence: "SLA allows 60s for /cache"
  - id: A2
    statement: "invalidation calls are safe to repeat"
    status: user-confirmed
    epistemology: judgment
    evidence: |
      Idempotency is a standard property for cache
      invalidation. Multiple calls remove the same
      entry; no side effects beyond that.
  - id: A3
    statement: "upstream supports ETag-based refresh"
    status: agent-inferred
    epistemology: hypothesis
    confidence: 0.85
    evidence: |
      Upstream sends ETag headers; we honour them when
      refreshing expired entries. Needs verification.
```

## Refinement

# Refinement: cache-ttl

## State

- pre: cache miss (no entry for key)
- post: cache hit (entry exists, age < TTL)

## Operation

On read, check entry timestamp. If age > TTL, refresh from
upstream. On explicit --cache-invalidate, evict the entry
immediately.

## Mapping

| spec state         | impl state                  |
|--------------------|------------------------------|
| cache hit          | dict.get(key) returns value  |
| cache miss         | dict.get(key) returns None   |
| expired entry      | age > TTL, refresh upstream  |
| invalidated entry  | dict.pop(key) (immediate)    |

## Invariant preservation

- Cache entries never served beyond TTL.
- Manual invalidation is immediate (no waiting for TTL).
- Idempotency: multiple invalidation calls have the same
  effect as one.

## Test obligation

tests/contract/test_cache_ttl.spec:
  - test_ttl_default_60s: write entry, sleep 61, read
    (expect upstream fetch)
  - test_ttl_configurable: set TTL=5s, sleep 6, read
    (expect upstream fetch)
  - test_invalidation_immediate: write entry, invalidate,
    read (expect miss)
  - test_invalidation_idempotent: invalidate twice, write,
    invalidate twice (expect same result as one call)

## Runtime check

Periodic log: "cache: N hits, M misses, K evictions" every
hour. Alerts if miss rate > 50%.
