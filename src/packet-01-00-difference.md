# 00-difference

This packet realises [[docs/axioms.md#a0-difference-ontological|axiom Difference]].

## Thesis

A proposition is a claim in language. An implementation is
a sequence of executable symbols. They are not the same
thing. Without this gap, math-coding has nothing to bridge.

Consider a junior developer who writes:

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

and commits it without a test, without a comment, without
a story. The implementation exists. The proposition — what
this code is supposed to mean, in which context it is correct,
what it does not cover — does not. Six months later, someone
adds a string to the call. The result is wrong. Nobody knew
it was wrong, because the proposition was never recorded.

axiom Difference fixes this: the proposition is a separate
object from the code. It lives in `decision.md`. It has a
`task.md` that states the intent. It has `assumptions.yaml`
that names what is taken for granted. It has `refinement.md`
that maps the proposition to the implementation. The code is
the last step, not the first.

## Antithesis

If proposition equals implementation, no convention is needed.
Code that explains itself has no decision to record.

But code does not explain itself. A function `add(a, b)`
is correct in arithmetic and wrong in string concatenation.
The implementation carries no hint which one. The proposition
must come from somewhere. Without a separate place for it,
the developer guesses, the reviewer guesses, the user
discovers.

Some methods try to recover the proposition from the code —
docstrings, type annotations, formal specifications embedded
in the implementation. Each of these is a partial answer
that re-introduces the gap by another name. axiom Difference
says: do not hide the gap. Name it.

## Synthesis

axiom Difference grounds math-coding on difference. Each
axiom that follows exists because some proposition differs
from some implementation. axiom Curry-Howard names this
bridge. axiom Self-Application verifies that the bridge
holds when the convention applies it to itself.

The five-file packet is the practical form of axiom
Difference:

  packet.yaml      — the manifest, the type signature
  decision.md      — the proposition, the claim
  task.md          — the intent, the goal
  assumptions.yaml — the context Γ, what we take for granted
  refinement.md    — the elaboration, how the claim unfolds

Without axiom Difference, the five files collapse to one.
With axiom Difference, each file has a job.

## A worked example

The `def add(a, b)` example above is itself a worked
example. The proposition is "integer addition" (recorded
in `decision.md:thesis`); the implementation is
`return a + b` (in `src/`). axiom Difference says: the
proposition and the implementation are not the same. The
reader of the proposition knows the implementation is wrong
when the input is a string — even though the implementation
is indistinguishable from a correct integer addition.

Without axiom Difference, `decision.md` does not exist;
without `decision.md`, the proposition is invisible; without
the proposition, the bug returns at 4 AM. axiom Difference
is what makes the convention useful.

## Surface impact

touches: packet.yaml (the manifest), decision.md (the
proposition), task.md (the intent), assumptions.yaml (the
context), refinement.md (the mapping) — the five-file
structure itself

## Proof

The evidence is axiom Self-Application. axiom Difference
is real if and only if the five files of every packet
remain distinct. The probe `sh core/self/probe.sh`
verifies this: check 1/6 asserts every `math/<pkt>/` has
exactly five files. If axiom Difference fails — if
somebody collapses the five files into one — the probe
exits non-zero. axiom Self-Application closes the loop
that axiom Difference opens.

## Task

# 00-difference

## Problem

What ontological claim underlies math-coding? What makes a
convention necessary at all?

## Desired outcome

A single axiom — A0 — that states why convention must exist.
Every other axiom derives from it.

## Constraints

- The axiom must be ontological, not motivational.
- The axiom must apply at every scale (packet, project, convention).
## Assumptions

```yaml
task_id: 00-difference
assumptions:
  - id: A1
    statement: "proposition and code are different kinds of thing"
    status: user-confirmed
    epistemology: judgment
    evidence: |
      A proposition is a claim stated in language. Code is a
      sequence of executable symbols. No identity claim holds
      between them; the gap is the bridge's reason.
  - id: A2
    statement: "without difference, no bridge is needed"
    status: agent-inferred
    epistemology: fact
    confidence: 0.99
    evidence: |
      Curry-Howard names a bridge. A bridge presupposes two
      banks. Without two banks, there is nothing to bridge.
  - id: A3
    statement: "difference is fractal across scales"
    status: agent-inferred
    epistemology: fact
    confidence: 0.95
    evidence: |
      packet: proposition != 5 files
      project: intent != implementation
      convention: convention != code-convention```

## Refinement

# Refinement: 00-difference

## State

- pre: convention without foundation — propositions confused
  with code, no recording of decisions.
- post: convention grounded on A0 (Difference). Every axiom
  below derives from the gap between claim and realization.

## Operation

State the ontological difference between proposition and
implementation as axiom Difference. Treat this axiom as the seed
from which A1-A6 grow.

## Mapping

| scale | proposition-side | implementation-side |
|-------|------------------|----------------------|
| packet | decision.md | 5 files of packet |
| project | SURFACE.md (proposed) | src/, lib/, tests/ |
| convention | docs/axioms.md | core/, theories/ |

## Invariant preservation

- Every axiom below must reduce to A0 plus its own kind.
- No axiom may depend on hidden ontological claims.

## Test obligation

- axiom Self-Application — `sh core/self/probe.sh` —
  verifies that all 7 axioms cohere and that A0 sits at their
  base.

## Runtime check

None — A0 is structural.
